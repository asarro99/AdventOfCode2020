## AdventOfCode2020

This repository has the purpose to hold all the solutions and utilities that I will use
for [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). The solutions are not the best or the most efficient.
Proposals to improve them or other are always accepted.

### Running Days

The program runs day or every day test based on a control in the main class, that is, it runs on the current day until
the advent period ends. An example of day output is:

```text
Day 1:
Part 1: 234
Part 2: 567
Completed in 0.529s
```

### Data Manager and Input File

The program can automatically read the inputs of a specific day **using the Advent Of Code servers**. To do this, you
need to create a `session.txt` file containing the site's session cookie. If the files are successfully obtained form
the server, they are stored in a dedicated file in the `aoc_input` directory.
